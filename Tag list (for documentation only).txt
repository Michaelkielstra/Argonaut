JavaScript _tags:
Area		The object in question is an area (NEVER room, although it is recommended to implement rooms as areas.)
Portable	The object in question may be picked up and carried around by the player.  (Many IF systems have this implemented by default.  This one doesn't.)
invisible The object in question is not to be mentioned by the LOOK command.  Similar to Inform's scenery.

HTML tags:
data-content        Generic 'content'.  Generally used with data-hypertextType, below.
data-hypertextType  Used for filling and cycling text.  Possible values: fill, cycle.
                    Fill: replaces the text with the data-content when the object is clicked.  For example, you might have <a data-hypertextType='fill' data-content='canine quadruped'>dog</a>.  This produces a link with the text 'dog', which, when clicked, changes to have the text 'canine quadruped'.
                    Cycle: switches between the comma-separated values in the content when the object is clicked.  For example, you might have <a data-hypertextType='cycle' data-content='dog, cat'>animal</a>.  This starts by displaying 'animal'.  When clicked, it changes to dog, then cat, then dog, then cat..., NEVER RETURNING TO ANIMAL.
                    Sequence: the same as Cycle but, instead of going back to the start, disables the link.  Used for when you want the sequence to end instead of repeat.
data-area           An area that is to be associated with the link.  When the player leaves an area with a _name corresponding to the value of this attribute, the object is replaced with the current text it is displaying.  This is an easy and effective way of disabling it.
